		<h1>RICE</h1>
		<ul class="inst">			
			<li>Rinse -  Either use a mesh strainer or use a bowl and change the water several times until it runs clear.</li>
			<li>Soak - Overnight or just 30 minutes. Drain the rice or cook in this water. For the latter ensure 
			the correct rice to water ratio.</li>
			<li>Add Water -  usually 2 parts water to one part rice.</li>
			<li>Season-   To the rice and water, add half teaspoon (2.84 g) (a big pinch) of salt, a tablespoon (14 g) of butter 
			or oil. Then stir gently to mix.</li>


			<h3>In a Saucepan</h3>
			<p class="inst">Cook on high flame until the water starts boiling. Then, reduce heat to low and cover the pot with a tight fitting 
				lid. cook for ~10 minutes for long grain white rice, or until the water is absorbed, or until the rice feel 
				done.</p>
			<p class="inst">Let the rice rest covered for 5-10 minutes.</p>

			<h3>In a Pressure cooker</h3>
			<p class="inst">Most kinds of white rice will take 1 whistle and 5 minutes at low. Let the pressure release on its own before 
			opening. Cooking in a pressure cooker requires you use less water. Use 1.5 cups of water per cup of white rice instead 				of 2.</p>


			<h2>DONTs</h2>
				<ul class="donts">
					<li>Don't peek until the rice is done cooking. Some steam will escape and that won't be good.</li>
					<li>Don't mix the rice while it's cooking. This will lead to gummy rice.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>MISC</h2>
			<ul class="misc">
				<li>White rice has much less arsenic content than brown rice. Still soaking it in considerable amount of water 						(4-5 cups per cup of rice) and draining it before cooking can reduce the arsenic content by 50 to 80 
					percentage. This will take away some nutrition particularly B vitamins.</li>
				<li>Soaking white rice for half an hour, after rinsing it, is recommended by some. The claim is that it reduces 					the phytic acid content. But not for long grain or Basmati rice. Soaking is avoided to preserve the 
					 integrity of the grain. Brown rice should be left overnight.</li>
				<li>If you are soaking for just 15-20 mins then add 2 cups of water.If you are soaking for 30 mins and more add 					1.5 cups.</li>
				<li>In a pressure cooker, different kinds of rice need to be cooked for different lengths of time.</li>
					<ul>	
						<li>basmati rice -  	1 whistle and 5 minutes on low</li>
						<li>brown rice -	2 whistles	</li> 
						<li>kachcha chawal -	1 whistle	</li>
						<li>pakka chawal -	3 whistles on normal heat	</li>	
					</ul>

				<li>some add rice, salt and butter with the water before boiling, some add these after the water has 
					boiled.</li>
				<li>butter or oil flavors the rice and helps to keep it from sticking together.</li>
				<li>Just before serving, fluff the rice with a fork or spoon. Ideally, let it sit for another 2 to 3 minutes 
					after fluffing before serving. This gives it some time to dry out so it's not too wet and sticky.</li>
				<li>If there's still water left in the pot when the rice is finished cooking, you should drain it. Just tilt 
					it till the excess drains out.</li>
			</ul>
